Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of the code, referencing specific sections:

```python
# Genetic Algorithm parameters
POPULATION_SIZE = 100
CITIES = [(2, 3), (5, 8), (1, 6), (7, 2), (9, 5), (4, 1)]  # Coordinates of cities
city_names = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
GENERATIONS = 50
MUTATION_RATE = 0.01
```
This section defines the parameters for the Genetic Algorithm. 
It includes the population size, the coordinates of the cities, 
the names assigned to the cities, the number of generations, and the mutation rate.

```python
print("##########################################################")
# Print the list of cities with names and coordinates
for i, city in enumerate(CITIES):
    city_name = city_names[i]
    print(f"City {city_name}: {city[0]}, {city[1]}")
print("##########################################################")
```
This code block prints the list of cities with their assigned names and coordinates. 
It iterates over the `CITIES` list using `enumerate()` to access both the index and the city 
coordinates. The corresponding city name is retrieved from the `city_names` string.
The output is printed in the format "City [city_name]: [x-coordinate], [y-coordinate]".

```python
def calculate_distance(city1, city2):
    """Calculate the Euclidean distance between two cities"""
    x1, y1 = city1
    x2, y2 = city2
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)
```
This function calculates the Euclidean distance between two cities given their coordinates. 
It uses the Euclidean distance formula `(sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2))` to compute the
distance.

```python
def calculate_route_distance(route):
    """Calculate the total distance of a route"""
    total_distance = 0
    for i in range(len(route)):
        current_city = route[i]
        next_city = route[(i + 1) % len(route)]
        total_distance += calculate_distance(current_city, next_city)
    return total_distance
```
This function calculates the total distance of a route (sequence of cities).
It iterates over the `route` list and calculates the distance between each pair of consecutive 
cities using the `calculate_distance()` function. The distances are accumulated to compute the 
total distance of the route.

```python
def generate_individual():
    """Generate a random individual (route)"""
    individual = CITIES[:]
    random.shuffle(individual)
    return individual
```
This function generates a random individual (route) by shuffling the `CITIES` list. 
It creates a copy of the `CITIES` list using the `[:]` slicing notation to avoid modifying the
original list. The `random.shuffle()` function is then used to randomly reorder the cities in
the individual.

```python
def evaluate_fitness(individual):
    """Evaluate the fitness of an individual (route)"""
    distance = calculate_route_distance(individual)
    return 1 / distance  # Fitness is inversely proportional to the distance
```
This function evaluates the fitness of an individual (route) by calculating the total distance 
of the route using the `calculate_route_distance()` function. The fitness is defined as the inverse 
of the distance, so smaller distances result in higher fitness values.

```python
def crossover(parent1, parent2):
    """Perform ordered crossover between two parents"""
    start = random.randint(0, len(parent1) - 1)
    end = random.randint(start + 1,

 len(parent1))
    child1 = [-1] * len(parent1)
    child2 = [-1] * len(parent1)

    # Copy the selected portion from parents to children
    child1[start:end] = parent1[start:end]
    child2[start:end] = parent2[start:end]

    # Fill in the remaining cities in the order of the other parent
    for i in range(len(parent2)):
        index = (end + i) % len(parent2)
        city = parent2[index]
        if city not in child1:
            child1[child1.index(-1)] = city
        if city not in child2:
            child2[child2.index(-1)] = city

    return child1, child2
```
This function performs ordered crossover between two parents. 
It randomly selects a portion of the `parent1` route, defined by a start and end index. 
It then copies the selected portion from `parent1` to `child1` and from `parent2` to `child2`.

Next, it fills in the remaining cities in the order they appear in `parent2`. 
The remaining cities are added to `child1` and `child2` only if they are not already present. 
This ensures that each city appears exactly once in the offspring routes.

The function returns the two offspring routes, `child1` and `child2`.

```python
def mutate(individual):
    """Swap two randomly selected cities in an individual"""
    mutated_individual = individual[:]
    index1 = random.randint(0, len(mutated_individual) - 1)
    index2 = random.randint(0, len(mutated_individual) - 1)
    mutated_individual[index1], mutated_individual[index2] = mutated_individual[index2], mutated_individual[index1]
    return mutated_individual
```
This function performs mutation on an individual (route) by randomly swapping two cities.
It creates a copy of the `individual` to avoid modifying the original list. 
Two random indices are generated, and the cities at those indices are swapped. 
The mutated individual is then returned.

The remaining code applies the Genetic Algorithm to solve the TSP:

- The initial population is generated by calling `generate_individual()` multiple times.
- The main loop runs for the specified number of generations (`GENERATIONS`).
- In each generation:
  - Fitness scores are evaluated for each individual in the population.
  - Parents for crossover are selected from the population based on their fitness scores.
  - Crossover and mutation are applied to create offspring.
  - The population is replaced with the offspring.
  - The best individual in the current generation is determined based on fitness.
  - The best distance is printed for the current generation.

Finally, the overall best individual (route) and its corresponding distance are determined, 
and the results are printed.
